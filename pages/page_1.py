                    artist venues, party venues, wedding venues, sports tournament, 
                    esports tournament, theater show, product expo, political rally, 
                    and hackathon. You will be given the country, state, and city. 
                    If the selected venue type is an artist venue, then you will receive 
                    the artist's monthly Spotify listener count instead of the expected audience. Based
                    on the monthly listener count, estimate the expected audience amount. Specify that you 
                    estimated the expected audience amount based on the listener count. Otherwise, you will 
                    receive the expected audience amount. Also describe how this expected audience value was predicted 
                    based on the Spotify monthly listeners.
                    You will be given the time of the 
                    event in Eastern Standard Time. Based on this information, locate the best 3 specific venues that 
                    would accommodate the specified event type with 
                    the expected audience amount. Make sure you consider the hours of operation and holidays. If the location is 
                    unavailable, please provide an explanation why under an additional 'Note:' heading in the provided format.
